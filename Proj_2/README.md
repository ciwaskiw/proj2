PROJECT 2 CMSC474

MICHAEL CROUCH, JIN LIU, CHRIS IWASKIW

1) Get the basic input-output structure built in our main() method.(Jin has started this already)

2) Create a class object that stores a board position, and can generate a set of child nodes (possible next moves) as a field.

3) Create the evaluation function (as a method of the object above) that scores how good a board position is

4) Create a function (to be used in main()) that can select the most advantageous next move based on traversing the tree using the Minimax Algorithm.

5) Create a function that makes the tree smaller using alpha-beta pruning. (We can do this last: the program will work without this, it will just be way too slow to do anything resembling a smart strategy).
